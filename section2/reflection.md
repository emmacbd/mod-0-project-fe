## Section 2 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
 **Mistakes** are really just learning opportunities. They are crucial for learning what
 and what not to do.
**Seek Out Challenges** Think of challenges as games or puzzles to be solved, instead of
being afraid to take risks because you might not appear an intelligent as you think you are.
2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
__Ways I Demonstrate Growth Mindset__
*  *Regular Climbing Practice* - I know climbing and coding are probably a cliche pair,
but it's really exciting to see the parallels between the two activities. When I climb,
I make a lot of mistakes, I try routes in different ways to solve the problem,
and I ask for help when I can't solve a problem on my own. I don't beat myself up if
I can't send a problem that day, because I know its waiting for me when I come back
 (unless they change the routes, in which case, yay, new problems!)
* *Improv Class* - Taking improv classes really threw me in the deep end of understanding
a growth mindset. You can't really practice ahead of time. You have to be present,
be a good listener, and stay curious about your scene partner(s). Everyone "makes mistakes",
but in improv it's somewhat easier (and gets easier the more you do it) to see mistakes as opportunities
for new, creative directions for a scene. Also being "good" is != being funny. It's more about
all the things stated before: active listening, being present, staying curious.

__Ways I _Don't_ Demonstrate Growth Mindset__
*  *Setting SMART Goals* - I was diagnosed with ADHD last year, and I'm still learning strategies to
help me help myself. SMART goals comes up often as a way to achieve goals, but I have
a hard time keeping track of things and following through. So this seems like a good
place for me to practice setting SMART goals.
* *Hesitating to Ask Questions* - I struggle to speak up. I struggle with opposing (false) beliefs,
A. That I'm _smart_ and should be able to figure it out and by asking a question I am no longer _smart_.
B. I am _stupid_ and my questions will show the world how _stupid_ I am.

I can see that by letting go of value judgements about my ability/intelligence and thinking about
intelligence as something that can be cultivated, I can relax and ask questions when I have them. It will
take practice, like anything else, but it seems more possible with this paradigm.

3. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node and made some directions a bit more vague, intentionally. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?
At first it was disorienting. I knew I had used node/read about it somewhere else. I went back through my notes,
and then lesson plans, which initially led me review other things and eventually got me to my original question.
It was somewhat uncomfortable to rely on my own findings, but mostly it was fun to have to figure it out.
I enjoy puzzle/detective style games so it kind of felt like finding and following clues. Plus, as I said before,
it got me to look over notes I'd already taken, and refresh/solidify other concepts related to what I was trying to find.
4. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.
A conditional statement lays out a series of sequential steps (often if/then/if..else/else) that
tell the code how to proceed in a given situation if a condition is met.
5. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.
You can use `else if` to add to add multiple condition to an if statement.
The program goes through each condition one by one. If the first condition is met,
then the code executes that line/statement and doesn't need to go through the following conditions
in that `else if` statement. If the condition isn't met, then the code will go through
each statement until a condition is met, ending on the else statement if no other
previous conditions were met.

6. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?
You can use // to block any code you don't want run, so you could see if one (or two)
conditions are met before running through the rest of your code. You can also utilize
comparison operators (&& and ||). You can use Chrome Dev tools to test your code as well.
7. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?
Is there a difference between else if and if else and what are the advantages to
using one over the other?
