## Section 3 Reflection

1. In Section 3, we removed even more supports and pushed you to learn a bit more independently, read through technical documentation, and use your resources more. How did that feel?

Overall it was pretty fun. I enjoy the hunt for clues and solving the puzzle. I reached out for
help on Slack for the first time too, which I knew I would have to do eventually and it was good
to rip off that bandaid.

2. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.
An example could be a playlist in Tidal. The elements of the array are songs. By rearranging
the songs in the playlist you would change the index positions.

3. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.
An array method is a tool in JS that performs a specific function. They can allow you
to update/change the array without having to go back into array itself. You cannot
change what an array method does.

4. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?
A loop is an efficient way to tell your code to perform an action however many times you want
without having to write code for each individual action. Using a loop in conjunction with
an array allows you to ask your code to perform an action on multiples pieces of data, in this
case all of the elements in your array. You would use a loop not in conjunction with an array
if you did not want or need that array to be looped through.

5. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?
A loop is like a magical machine that will say what you want it to say however
many times you want to say it. So lets say your favorite food is pancakes, and you want your computer
to say "I Love Pancakes!" a hundred times. You could type that sentence out, over and over, but that
would be a lot of work. Instead you could use a few magic words to build your magic loop machine,
tell it that you want it to say "I Love Pancakes!" a hundred times and then sit back and watch your
computer say back how much you love pancakes.

6. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?
Does the order of conditional statements affect how the loop runs, even if it's only going through one array? Is it possible to overexplain your conditions, in a way that is not only inefficient but affects what prints back?
